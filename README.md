#Just script collection

* post4to5.py - script that helps to migrate from BDS proj to XE version. I don't use tortoiseSvn because it was some problem with rename command (for BDS, XE. Use Python2.7)
* AutoTrackXE.py - add trace to each function/procedure and to finalization/initialization. (for XE. Use Python3)
* CheckoutProject.bat - auto checkout
